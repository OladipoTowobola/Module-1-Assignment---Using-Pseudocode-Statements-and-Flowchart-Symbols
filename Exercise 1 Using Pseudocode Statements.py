Exercise 1
// This pseudocode is intended to compute the number
// of miles per gallon you get with your automobile

Start
   Input BeginOdometer, EndOdometer, GallonUsed
   DistanceDriven = EndOdometer - BeginOdometer
   MilesPerGallon = DistanceDriven /  GallonUsed
   Output MilesPerGallon
Stop

   //Comments
   Start //Consistently found at the commencement of our pseudocode
   Input // User  prompted to enter BeginOdometer readings, EndOdometer readings, GallonUsed
   DistanceDriven // Calculates the differences between the EndOdometer readings and BeginOdometer readings
   MilesPerGallon // Calculates the DistanceDriven divided by GallonUsed to determine the  MilesPerGallon
   Output // Displays the calculated MilesPerGallon
   Stop //Process Ends
